# DicePowerPointAddIn

Do you know the problem of using multiple languages in PowerPoint? Shapes and text boxes always use the same (wrong) spell checking. Switching them manually takes 
forever and makes me (more) insane.
Therefore this offers a simple add in that iterates through all shapes and text boxes (generally all objects on a slide) and sets the language to what is specified.
Currently supports
- German
- English

Adding more is really simple tho. Its just that I don't need it.
